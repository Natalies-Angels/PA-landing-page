		<h4>Case study<br></h4>
		<p class="">
			Ken is a cis heterosexual male, 27 years of age. He is the fifth born of a family of six. He was easily forgotten growing up and his family did not mind much about his life. He grew up feeling abandoned and unloved by those closest to him. He sought that love elsewhere in friendship. Kendie, a transgender male, 28 years of age is the second born of a family of three. He has been friends with Ken since they joined the same school in class 4. Kendie was brought up by his mother, who separated from his father when he was 14 years old. They had an abusive marriage for years, where the father would verbally abuse and sometimes be physically violent with the mother. He was relieved when his mother chose to leave his father, but their marriage had left scars. Kennedy struggled with trust and was anxious about any form of relationship. One day Ken and Kennedy got into a fight, a fight that turned physical faster than they anticipated. Kennedy was surprised by the amount of anger he had inside him, feeling like he had become his father in the moment of the fight. Ken was angry that he was friends with someone Ken called an enemy. Ken had seen their pictures on Instagram hanging out and he came to his house fuming. Ken said he felt betrayed and he couldn’t believe the disloyalty. Kennedy was caught off guard and offended that Ken would equate his loyalty to stupid grudge-holding. Ken said some hurtful words like he was just as disloyal as his father incapable of being true to anyone. Kennedy in turn responded that he was just a lonely child who wouldn’t recognize love if hit him in the face. They were each in rage in seconds, in that moment they were their childhood versions arguing with their parents. They forgot the love they had for each other and before long they were throwing blows at each other. The neighbors intervened and Ken walked out fuming mad. A few months later, Ken is feeling remorseful for how he acted. He has been attending this support group that has helped him trace his rage roots to childhood. He realizes now he was fighting from a place of hurt and ended up losing a dear friend. He wants to reach out to Kennedy, apologize and see if he could earn his trust again.
