		<p class="">
			Stephen and Stanley were born into a family of 5 with a three-year difference between them. They were always competitive with each other as the only cis males of the family. Their father would make them compete against each other for almost everything including chores. Now as adults, they are still at it. They are both engineers as per their father’s advice with Stephen in electrical and Stanley in Software. Stephen is now married to his high school sweetheart and they are expecting a child. Stanley identifies as aromantic asexual, which means he has never had a romantic or sexual relationship and has no desire for one. His father is now pulling him away from people during family gatherings citing all the ways he is behind in the family-rearing business. It is making coming home hard for him especially because he has no desire for what Stephen has. All he sees is Stephen becoming miserable by the day, overwhelmed by debt to keep up with social status. His mother organized a bride for him, who he found home one day when he came home for Christmas festivities. His parents did not listen to him and they insisted on him going with her to Nairobi. Stanley doesn’t want to be disrespectful, but he has reached his wit's end. Stephen was in on it so were their three sisters, who were tasked with looking for the ‘perfect lady’ He feels unheard at home and he is contemplating cutting ties with them. Stephen has also been pushing the agenda by setting him up for dates whenever they meet up. He is tired of explaining himself so he chooses to see a psychiatrist to find out if something is wrong with him. It was then that he discovered that he is on the Asexual spectrum, which is normal. He hopes to be able to explain it to his parents. He has invited them to come for a therapy session with him despite their resistance. He wants to express the effects of the psychological and emotional abuse that being forced into relationships and dates has had on him.<br>
