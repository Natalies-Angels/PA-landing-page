		<p class="">Case study<br></p>
		<p cllabelass="">Ennie is a cis female lesbian, who was raised by a single parent in a family of three. Her mother had her when she was a teenager and struggled to do it alone. She would channel the rage to Ennie through beatings for things she thought she forgot to do and insults whenever she did something wrong. The dominant insult of Ennie being referred to as dumb and careless is her father. These words haunted her even in her school work and life. She always felt subpar no matter what she achieved. She is currently 35 years old and working as the head of marketing in a top company. Her relationship with her mother is still murky with her calls being full of criticism of how she chooses to live her life, childless and husbandless. Ennie met Elle a few months ago, they have been going out. Elle is a non-binary pansexual born to a family of ten. They are the firstborn and are always hyper independent. They struggle to ask for help and trust people. They do better in life when they do it themselves. They have been called controlling before. Ennie and Elle have very heated arguments when they disagree, which happens a lot. Elle has a habit of walking away while Ennie likes to solve things as quickly as possible. Ennie gets agitated by them walking away and it makes every other fight more intense. On this day, Ennie cannot keep the agitation at bay and they look Elle inside the house, shouting at them that they must solve it. Elle is aggravated by this and can’t believe she would go to that length. Elle bangs on the door and then turns to Ennie calling her an insecure wreck looking to be saved. Ennie is triggered by this and hears all the insults similar to what her mum said to her. She is so in rage that she is seeing blank, nothing matters more than hurting the source of the words. The fight turns violent, Elle manages to take the keys and leaves on a limping leg. Ennie is left shocked at what she did and how angry Elle became after that first punch. They have not talked for weeks after the fight. Elle blocked her. Ennie has been seeing a therapist now and she realizes that her arguments were never about Elle, but the aspects of them that reminded her of her mother. Ennie feels so guilty for how it escalated but is betrayed by the words and actions Elle turned to. She hopes they can heal together.</p>
