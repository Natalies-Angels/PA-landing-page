            <h4>Agape VS Stoic</h4>
            <p>Agape is often defined as unconditional, sacrificial love. Agape is the kind of love that is felt by a
                person willing to do anything for another, including sacrificing themselves, without expecting anything
                in return. In this case, we focus on love for self.</p>

     <h4>Case study</h4><br>
		<p class="">Sebo is a transgender female who has struggled through the journey of transition. Her family did not support her pursuit of autonomy. She was born to a family of 5, with a father who lives more on the road than at home. The mother is a religious homemaker, who believes the woman’s place is in the kitchen, second to the man. Sebo and the mother’s best moments were spent in the kitchen exploring recipes and gossiping about which of the aunties is having an affair. They were close and she never commented on her mannerism like other people. Her mother would defend her saying she was special. Their relationship took a hit the day Sebo showed up home as her real self. The mother got on her knees and prayed. Asking god for her son back. The home was never the same and her mother could never look at her asking her why she couldn’t wear normal clothes at home and do the girly thing on her own time. Sebo was hurt by this, of all the people she thought the mum would be the most understanding. She chooses to stay at home to fix it with her mum, but she has something hurtful to say every day. Sebo has formed a habit of repeating her mother’s words in the mirror. The pain has become addictive. Sebo’s mother talked her into going to church to choir practice, something they did together often. Driven by the nostalgia Sebo agreed only to discover that it was an exorcism, where she was tossed on the middle of a circle with the church people praying for her. She couldn't shake the image of hatred and disgust in her mother’s eyes, but still, she hoped she could convince the mum. They were close once, they can be close again. She would think. Sebo met someone at the market, who has been supportive and loving. She was the first person to notice how Sebo whispered to herself while biting her nails. Sebo told her what she whispered, her mother’s words. The friend was shocked and asked why she would do that to herself. Sebo believed that if she did it long enough, she would become what the mum wanted and they would be close again. The friend pointed out that the words are erasing her, making her what she isn’t and doing more harm. Sebo had never thought of it that way, which made her realize how unhappy she had been since coming back home. She had not smiled or laughed in a long time. The friend invited Sebo to a meet-up, where people share what they are going through and coping. Sebo has begun to see the self-harm she was instilling in herself when someone in the group shared something similar. She has started intentionally saying affirming words to herself in the mirror and has moved into a communal home with fellow queers. She hopes the mum can see beyond her transition to the child, she knew and loved. The mother still sends bible verses.</p>
